# Overview

This folder contains code used in the first submission of the article,
but not used in the second version. For the exact code used in the article,
see the subfolder *pre_ipopt*.

A new and improved version of the examples can be found in this folder,
were IPOPT is used to find the optimal orientation of the object,
instead of a naive steepest descent.

In the subfolder *verification*, several tests for computing material derivatives with MultiMesh is added. These tests are not used in the paper, as
the second submissions contains argumentation for using the Hadamard formulation.
